something causes google analytics tag fire note approach not work content iframe example embed youtube video page not capture clicks buttons etc using general approach generate lot data crappy data let look reducing amount data tracking certain types clicks tracking outbound links want know people go visit site leave using link article navigate away track click outbound link follow general process outlined big difference need make sure track clicks links go another site first add link click listener tag necessary pages usually outbound links every page apply link click listener tag every page site link click listener tag listen user clicks links need add analytics tag collect data click happens let use google analytics collect data event notice hard coding event category value outbound link event action dynamically filled destination page user land made possible thanks element macro element macro automatically add destination google analytics event important part tag rule notice two parts rule first need check clicks links also added additional condition stipulates link must not match cutroni domain blog google analytics tag fire collect click link different domain add rule specify outbound link clicks site tracking file downloads file downloads similar outbound link clicks use different listener tag let skip analytics tag collect data using google analytics event category hard coded file download event action file dynamically populated using element macro element macro automatically add google analytics event data like outbound link tracking need modify rule include condition condition specifies user clicked link contains track link click add condition tag firing rule hopefully use example track clicks type file want tracking form submissions let move forms could track form using click listener tag basically would track clicks submit button form start form submission listener tag rather add tag every page site like add pages form form listener tag configured delay form submission data collected also notice configure form listener tag delay form submission insure data collected tag delay form two seconds anything longer create bad user experience gtm smart like like click tracking also form submit event generated user submits form use event set analytics tag rule control execution rule fire google analytics event tag form submitted
