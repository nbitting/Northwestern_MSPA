data change get request send characters data technically post length setting servers around characters sending data google analytics information hit transformed dimensions processing every report single dimension corresponding metrics value see reports report google analytics shows values single dimension corresponding metrics value quick note mobile mobile sdks not send data real time actually store hits locally send bursts called dispatching used couple reasons first mobile devices not always connected network analytics must store hits detects connection sends hits second sending hits bunches help conserve battery life worry dispatching not impact session calculations ll talk right session session simply collection hits user grouped together default analytics tools including google analytics group hits together based activity analytics tool detects user no longer active terminate session start new one user becomes active analytics tools use minutes inactivity separate sessions minute period called timeout session collection hits ends minutes inactivity google analytics tools use time first hit last hit calculate time site time hits also used calculate metrics like time page read overview google analytics performs time calculations tools let change default timeout better suit needs example lot video site might want change timeout especially video last minutes user watching minute video watching mean no hits sent analytics session end minutes first hit insure session lasts end video could change timeout match longest video length better way extend session would send additional hits user watching video think hits create data points used calculate time trust take minutes read google analytics performs time calculations know hits grouped together sessions let look sessions grouped based users users things start get interesting user tools best guess anonymous person users identified using anonymous number string characters analytics tool normally creates identifier first time user detected identifier persists expires deleted identifier sent analytics tool every hit data analytics tools group hits thus sessions together using identifier hits make sense sessions user grouped together long hit user id users detected today common digital platforms website users measure user website almost analytics tools use cookie cookie small text file cookie contains anonymous identifier every time hit sent browser back analytics server identifier stored cookie sent along data measuring website analytics tool usually uses first party cookie store anonymous id let cookie talk google analytics uses first party cookie first party cookie connected domain creates first party used domain sets site cookie domain cutroni com used website universal analytics cookie named ga lasts two years previous version google analytics cookie named utma good thing first party cookie almost browsers allow first party cookie reliable piece technology first party cookies challenging site spans multiple domains user leaves site traverses another site not take first party cookies situations unless configure analytics correctly analytics set another cookie user lands second domain analytics uses first party cookie maintain user identifier one user two cookies could lead double counting users plus want create really cool metrics like revenue per user becomes hard know true number users type cookie third party cookie set accessed domains domain creates analytics tools let use third party cookie value third party cookie analytics tool use third party cookie identify user move one domain another third party cookie used multiple domains however third party cookies not permitted browsers means no data google analytics not use third party cookie read google analytics cookies developer documentation solution correctly identify user website spans multiple domains google analytics world use feature called cross domain tracking not going talk post read support documentation mobile users let move mobile platforms something popular mobile tracking similar web tracking anonymous identifier stored device identifier generated every time app installed user deletes app identifier also deleted user updates app identifier not change big difference mobile web identifier not stored cookie stored database mobile device basically functions way cookie identifier sent every hit back analytics server analytics server uses identifier create metrics like unique users one challenge user measurement app many apps not app re hybrid app website use browser within app frame content website mess data collection situation two technologies two different user identifiers app measure user based id stored device website use cookie page loads app mobile apps frame content website might sending duplicate hits analytics tool ways around long solution need blog post aware potential data issue ok know website users mobile users digital touch points like kiosk digital touch points today world user interact digital content lots different devices computers mobile kiosks set top boxes etc cause lot issues tools try de duplicate users get accurate count users one key features universal analytics ability track users devices websites mobile devices things like point sale system kiosk using technology called measurement protocol actually work measurement protocol works wait collecting hits hits described big difference must manually build hits want implement analytics kiosk must create code build hits sent google analytics measuring users use measurement protocol create hit must insert user identifier hit google analytics use identifier unique identifier processes data measure users tracking devices like kiosk must insert identifier generate data hits unlike websites mobile apps no cookie database store identifier id not persist one hit another one session another must manually insert identifier every hit every session code must control generation identifier storage identifier let end pretty good overview digital analytics data know really geeky post important subject become important turn thoughts please feel free leave
