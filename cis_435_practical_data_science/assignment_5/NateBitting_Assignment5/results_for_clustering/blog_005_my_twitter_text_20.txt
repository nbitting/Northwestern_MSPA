listings listing pages click distance duplicate content listings products services offers etc staple marketplace site pages generally pagination keep number items page manageable navigation filter listed items specific categories number items grows two problems start emerge click distance number items grows eventually product listing not fit one page number pages grows pagination likely not show pages either flickr pagination transitioned infinite scrolling notice pages deep within site like page example won found search engine large amount crawling done mentioned inner linking structure important search engines able find listed products especially not receive many external links one signals google uses determine importance pages site many hops required reach homepage often termed click distance things equal page links deep homepage rank higher page links deep example pagination one shown hurts putting deeper pages much farther homepage initial pages aside last pages pagination format shown taken flickr inner pages quite far homepage hence products link high click distance well ve noticed practice time products previously received good organic search traffic started trail almost completely disappeared search results eventually theorized click distance might culprit parameter changed theory proven correct pages regained serp rankings applying solutions rel next prev meta tags signal google paginated pages indeed part series using meta link tag attributes rel next rel prev approach detailed official google webmaster blog go details another option show page might relevant case depending type amount content show render pagination links page approach might seem conflict somewhat advice google provides always preferring best user experience provide shortest click distance immediate availability pages listing works especially well modern pagination interaction infinite scrolling provide pagination links page hide javascript search engines text readers not javascript enabled see normal pagination links users get seamless pagination experience approach currently using listing page javascript disabled see following pagination appearing load projects button not necessarily visually appealing still functional javascript enabled however pagination hidden clicking load projects button start process loading additional projects scroll click stop loading button allowing reach implement infinite scrolling like interaction make sure still works without javascript enabled flickr using interaction javascript disabled no option get inner pages fact images beneath fold even load without javascript quite sad duplicate content indexed pages possible combination filters listing page show results common case filter combinations yield zero results since different assuming using links filtering discussed inner linking section google consider pages duplicate content happens google might hard time deciding version content serve search results page incoming link juice split versions people might link either versions avoid consolidate page rank category employ rel canonical meta tag indicates one canonical version page side effect filter combinations creating many different urls google actually index variations added canonization index swelled pages even though many meaningful pages canonizing main filter combinations index size decreased time reaching stable state around pages indexed important surely google resources index pages easily problem depending much importance google places site often thinks content changes many pages indexed result much slower index update like content changes seo optimizations propagate google index faster would help present google fewer pages index crawl stats webmaster tools show crawl rate fairly constant time pages per day means google completely re index entire site days previously took almost months simplification since pages crawled often others various factors stands reason indexed pages given priority signal google importance pages site using sitemap indicating priority update rate help google make informed choices often crawl content sitemap also helpful sites dynamic content marketplaces listings user generated new listings immediately reflected sitemap increasing likelihood added search index sooner rather later optimizing appearance search engine results pages serps getting products ranked search results first step need get people click couple factors big influence whether user skim product click search results title description google uses meta title description tags pages generate search results optimizing clarity relevancy makes big difference click rates serps titles concise informative explain page words got idea stack overflow added product keywords title might match relevant searches product since marketplaces listings makes sense dedicated field short form description fit internal listing appear serps gives opportunity optimize click rates microformats microformats rich snippets special markups provide additional semantic information depending type content listings choose variety microdata formats send additional information search engines help optimize appearance results site search results pages serps short types content include see bottom help page information reviews people products businesses organizations recipes events video content tagged microformat markups might appear different serps example reviews might show review rating search result avatar reviewer products might show pricing rating well videos might show video thumbnail forth modified appearance search results help attract attention increase engagement meaningful structured urls investing urls look not work yield benefits seo user experience technical standpoint easiest way link products listing would point unique identifier often incrementing integer results urls look something like listing view id easy program not meaningful site visitors also missing opportunity convey information search engines rand fishkin moz good somewhat old post topic suggest read marketplaces ecommerce sites suggest including title product replacing query parameters folder like structure blogging platforms wordpress long time replacing post id better looking includes post date title separated slashes folder like structure instead omitting listing id completely adding another layer unique identifiers products wordpress blog posts go hybrid approach one used stack overflow questions unique identifier typically integer descriptive string compose latter approach went product pages creating urls product called videostream sdk ios unique identifier sub pages product page comments reviews support etc urls based structure additional inner folder comments reviews support respectively modern mvc routing creating structure pretty easy re using zend framework router create scheme google binpress listing results side side word caution approach shown string part urls not affect product shown numeric identifier controls initially didn pay attention multiple urls mapping product creates duplicate content problem search engines discussed earlier section listing pages case however better solution using canonical tag would issue redirect moved permanently canonical version forces browser always current version address line regardless link got visitor looked different case discussed listing different combinations filters yielded results situation could change time products added listing structured urls listing urls listing pages cleaned well replacing query parameters readable folder structure current listing structure looks like parts prefixed dynamic map variables names basically replaces looks like much readable compact version also conveying hierarchy parts search engines order appearance since mimic folder structure ajax search engines ajax pretty common method enhancing user experience changing parts page sending information server without refreshing page however using ajax show content could prevent appearing search results no way get content since search engines crawl pages statically not trigger user interaction links several ways address using content fragments supported google handle progressive enhancement instead think straightforward creating special versions using query parameters create content first without ajax complete linking structure covers add ajax top speed load times improve user experience makes sense approach product pages clicking tabs changes content tab not sidebar tabs real links time linking full version content opened separately different tab example search engine similar fashion listing pages real links pagination filter navigation applying filters asynchronously
